# PATHS Lab Repository

This is where our lab's manual, sanitizing protocols, and other documents will be publicly available for other researchers to see how we work.
The main purposes of this repo are for us to be transparent about our methods, allow for constructive criticism, and to provide open-source tools to other researchers.
